Overview
========

Matrix graphically  displays  information about  the current  status of 
the Falcon sound matrix. This is the hardware that allows diverse parts
of the  sound system  to be linked  together independantly of  the main 
processor. It also allows the monitored track to  be altered, the sound 
system to be  reset or  locked, and  the input to be switched from  the 
external Analogue to Digital converter to the PSG.


Requirements
============

Falcon, 1Mb memory, resolution of 640x200 or above.


Installation/Starting Matrix
============================

Matrix can be run  either as a  program or as  a desk accessory. To run 
as  a program,  simply double click  the MATRIX.PRG  icon. To run as an 
accessory, rename  to  MATRIX.ACC, copy  to  your  boot/desk  accessory 
directory and reboot.


Using Matrix
============

On the right  is a  panel showing  the sound  matrix (in grey)  and the
outputs  to which the  current input is  connected (in red, or black on 
a mono monitor). Clicking  the 'Show Thru'  button graphically displays 
some of  the  additional connections that may  exist (in  blue, or grey 
arrows on a mono system).

To change  the  current  input, click  on the  name of the input on the 
left hand side of the panel.

The sound system  can be reset  using the 'Reset Snd' button and locked
using the  'Lock Snd'  button. The  ADC/PSG input  can be set to PSG by 
clicking the 'PSG Input' button. The  track which is  currently audible 
through the internal  speaker can be set using the bank of buttons with 
'Monitor' above them.

If you run Matrix as an  accessory, other programs may change the sound
matrix status while the Matrix window  is open. The display will update
as  soon as the  Matrix window is  redrawn. This usually  happens quite 
often if you are moving windows about etc., but if you wish to force an
update, you can do it by  closing Matrix and reopening it from the Desk
menu.
