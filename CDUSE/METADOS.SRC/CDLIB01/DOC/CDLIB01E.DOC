
I wrote this little GNU C++ library to get a CD audio control easy access...


Short explanations (you don't need more) :

The "CdDrive" class provides most of the commands you might
want to use : play, pause, resume, stop...

CD errors can be handled with the "CdStatus" class.

Total CD length and track positions are managed with the "CdLocation"
and "CdTrackLocation" classes.



These codes are based on the "cdromio.h" and "metados.h" patched for
GNU C++ use.

The cdplay01 prog shows an example of using this library.
It works fine on my Falcon with the Extendos driver and my NEC drive...


Please tell me about any improvement you might add.
