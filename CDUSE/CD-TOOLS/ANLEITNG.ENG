DOCUMENTATION TO CD-TOOL AND CDDA

    Cordial Welcome from our new Product `CD-Tool'. We know: 
    nobody read gladly Documentation. Still want_to we Them 
    commend, least one Deal the series Description to read, 
    about it IrrtÅmer and MiûverstÑndnisse to ersparen.

    For the all Eiligen:


SCHNELLINSTALLATION FOR THOSE, THE IT ALL HURRY HAVE

    (1) Launch You `CD-TOOL.APP'. Click You in Menu `METADOS' the Dot 
    `Installation' to. Choose You in the Dialogbox for 
    `ISO9660-Dateisystem' one in System bislang not used 
    Laufwerksbuchstaben (taxi Display top). Press You RETURN, about the 
    Configuration to save.

    (2) Launch You that System new. Impose You a Data-CD one and open 
    you that in Degree (1) gives_to Disk_drive. It supposed_to now the Data 
    to the CD show become.

    (3) You intend a Audio-CD abspielen? Then launch You `CDDA.APP' 
    or copy You `CDDA.ACC' in that Root_symbol the 
    Bootlaufwerks. The point_at(?) Keys act in about so, as 
    one it by one CD-Player expected.

    (4) Irgendetwas functions not as expected? Luck, then must You 
    now good still the Residue the Documentation read.


    You have it by hierhin geschafft? Fine. Then intend we to one 
    couple Basics shrink, the for Comprehension the Concern high 
    important where.


WHY REQUIRED ONE ACTUAL ONE SPECIAL DRIVER FOR CD-ROMS?

    That ask it many, and not all to harm. Eventual is one 
    CD-ROM from the Sight the Computer yes also negation others as a 
    groûe Wechselplatte, the not describe become can. This true, 
    and indeed where the Programmteile, the it with the CD-ROM 
    `amuse', (almost) with then from one Festplattentreiber identical 
    (by the Block_size and determines SpezialitÑten as Audio-Commands 
    apart).

    The Unterschiede lie to one other Area: during to 
    Festplattem the Files in the Fashion and Manner be_saved where, as you 
    that GEMDOS in ROM the Ataris expected, will_be to CDs one others 
    `Dateisystem' use. This not unconditional, about us that Being schwerer 
    to do, but because from high groûen Datenmengen, the indeed 
    never changes become, other Format plain effektiver where.

    Data-CDs -- by_it belong also Photo-CDs -- abstain so in 
    Allgemeinen one sogenanntes `ISO-9660-Dateisystem'. This must one 
    anyhow the Operating_system unterschieben.

    Atari have it already pretty early that befaût. Herausgekommen is 
    the Operating_system_extension `METADOS', the to all Ataris works 
    and a relative flexible Anbindung latter GerÑte and Dateisysteme 
    possible might. Neueren Original is natural `MULTITOS' rather. `MINT', 
    that a clean other Method to_the Einbindung latter GerÑte vorsieht.

    `METADOS' comprises from three Divide. `METADOS.PRG' is one 
    AUTO-File-Program, that the Invasion in_the Operating_system taken, 
    it about that Read the Konfigurationsdatei kÅmmert etc. 
    `BOS'-Driver bother it about the Communication with the GerÑten, 
    parallel so in about the, which one Festplattentreiber might. The 
    `DOS'-Driver hingegen bother it about other Dateisystemformate.

    Before we us now this Component nÑher credit, must we alas 
    early once one couple Fachbegriffe from the CD-ROM-World comprehend (i 
    verspreche, it brief and schmerzlos to do):

    DOUBLE-SPEED: normally turns it the CD in Disk_drive just_as 
    fast, as it also from Audio-GerÑten the Case is. With_them come from 
    Data-CDs round 150 KByte per Second to nutzbaren Data out, which 
    for many Application(?) one little lean is. Hence where Disk_drive, the 
    Data-CDs double so fast rotieren have, meantime Standard. 
    Some Maker afford even GerÑte with three- or vierfacher 
    öbertragungsrate to. One beachte indeed, that it the mittlere 
    Zugriffszeit most not in demselben Mass improved!

    XA: CDs in XA-Format improve one spezielles Aufzeichnungsformat, that 
    by Ñlteren CD-ROMs often not read become can. Photo-CDs where 
    normally in XA-Format describe! [1.10]

    MIXED-FASHION-CD: a CD, the both Data as also MusikstÅcke contains. 
    [1.10].

    MULTISESSION: neuerdings give it also CDs, the in several `Sitzungen' 
    vollgeschrieben become can. With_them become though never the already 
    available Data Åberschrieben, but it come new hinzu. This is 
    for_example then the Case, if You with another Photo-CD one zweites 
    Times for FotohÑndler go and wider Image draufschreiben have. 
    If this wider `Session' read can become shall, then need 
    You one `Multisession-fÑhiges' Disk_drive.

    ISO9660: this is the Name the normally to CD-ROMs used 
    Dateisystems. As the Name already say, installation it it not about 
    irgendeinen `de-facto'-Standard, but about a internationale Mark. 
    ISO9660 can Åbrigens either (`Level 1') the Åblichen 
    DOS-Filename (8+3 Mark) or by to 32 Mark long Filename 
    abstain (`Level 2', this gets indeed just high rare before). To 
    jeden Case is but the maximum Verzeichnistiefe to 8 File 
    narrow. [1.06]

    HIGH-SIERRA: before that ISO9660-Format fixed becomes, gave it already 
    one alas not all kompatibles VorgÑngerformat. Actual ought 
    it barely still such_as CDs give, but from unerfindlichen Base become 
    also today still sometimes such_as CDs produziert.

    PHOTO-CD rather. PCD: Image to Photo-CDs improve one spezielles 
    Dateiformat, that alas just by wenigen Programs read become 
    can. Indeed find You in Lieferumfang a Copy by Dieter 
    Fiebelkorns `GEM-View', that PCD-Files by to_the Resolution by 768*512 
    load and in other Format conversion can. Conceive You but on_it, 
    that You that Program from regelmÑûiger Use fee must 
    (Registrierkarte bed from!). Photo-CDs improve Åbrigens that 
    ISO-Dateisystem. [1.10]

    PHOTO-CD PORTFOLIO: a Photo-CD, the additional also a or 
    several Tonspuren contains. [1.06]


    Any Parts by `METADOS' where now usable?

    The `BOS'-Driver (`CDARGEN.BOS') functions just with CD-ROMs at_best 
    SCSI-Port the TT as_soon_as with the `Atari CDAR 504' (just in slight 
    StÅckzahlen verkauft) to the ACSI-Cut_place(?). Besides supports he 
    no_one Multisession-CDs. Hence have we one new Driver 
    developed, the handelsÅbliche SCSI-GerÑte as_soon_as that `Atari CDAR504' 
    supports. [1.12]

    The `DOS'-Driver (`ISO9660F.DOS' and `HSMAY.DOS') have though one couple 
    little_one `Macken' (taxi onward bottom), fill but their Dismissal 
    weitestgehend zufriedenstellend. Still have we you through one 
    eigenen, new Driver replace (`HS-ISO.DOS'), the not just one little 
    faster is, but automatic among High-Sierra- and ISO-CDs 
    difference and besides any nachsichtiger in_contrast_to solchen CDs is, 
    from then the Maker from_the ISO-Standard abgewichen where. 
    DarÅberhinaus become also the Level-2-CDs with long Filename 
    supports. [1.12]

    `METADOS' even functions unseres Wissens meantime high 
    stable. The Service under `MULTITOS' or `MAGIC' (vormals `May!x') 
    is prinzipiell possible, can but in EinzelfÑllen to Fehlfunktionen 
    carry. Basic: `METADOS' is not to that `Task-Switching' this 
    System usable. If You `METADOS' under `MULTITOS' rather. `MINT' 
    insert intend, then heed You on, that the File `MINT.PRG' 
    rather. `MINTNP.PRG' to `METADOS.PRG' in AUTO-File placed [1.30].

    The in_front_of Version by `CD-Tool' befaût it hence in first 
    Line with the Divide, where unserer Estimation to special 
    Handlungsbedarf vorlag:

    `CD-TOOL.APP': one komfortables Installations- and Diagnoseprogramm 
    (`METADOS' will_be normally about a any big verstÑndliche 
    ASCII-File configures; this Employment take Them `CD-Tool' down).

    `HS-CDROM.BOS': one Driver for CD-ROMs to ACSI-, TT-SCSI or 
    Falcon-SCSI, the also Multisession-CDs supports.

    `HS-ISO.DOS': Driver for ISO- and High-Sierra-CDs. [1.06]

    `CDDA.APP' rather. `CDDA.ACC': one little Program rather. Accessory, about 
    Audio-CDs abzuspielen.

    `ID-TEST.APP': one simple Testprogramm, that for all ACSI- and 
    SCSI-GerÑte the GerÑtenamen show. Can helpful be, about to the 
    Fast find_out, if one Appliance Åberhaupt correct connected(?) 
    is.

    `STOPLOCK.CPX': one XControl-Modul for Bar the Auswurftaste. 
    Must in that Directory with the other CPX-Modulen copies become.

    If You it wundern, where for now the altogether other describe 
    Files (`HS-CDROM.BOS', `HS-ISO.DOS' and `METADOS.PRG') pop: we 
    have you in the Archivdatei `CD-TOOL.LIB' covert, that You not 
    with so many Files herumhantieren must. [1.12]

    That have You the Introduction Åberstanden, come we to_the 
    Description by `CD-Tool':



CD-TOOL

    From the Service by `CD-Tool' where those clear in Convenience, the 
    already their Experienced with `SCSI-Tool' leisure have. Who it 
    spoken_to fÅhlt, can presumable problem alike at Menu_point 
    `METADOS' weiterlesen.

    `CD-Tool' lust alike to Advent to CD-ROMs. With_them become all 
    on_closing(?) GerÑte untersucht. ATTENTION: if You a 
    Vortex-Harddisc the Baureihe `HD-PLUS' improve, then must this 
    either off be, or `CD-Tool' must so configures be, 
    that it not to the appropriate Device_number zugreift.

    As that go: either during the Programmstarts a the 
    Shift-Keys hold or that Program with the Option `-i' launch. 
    It appear then a Dialogbox, in the the abzuprÅfenden 
    GerÑtenummern installed become can.

    To erfolgreichem Programmstart figure the Menu_bar as_soon_as one 
    Programmfenster. All Functions in `CD-ROM'-Menu subscribe_to it in 
    Default to the here show Dish. If just one CD-ROM 
    found becomes, shows that Window alike the zugehîrigen 
    Information. Anderenfalls can one that GerÑte about `CD-ROM -- 
    pick' select. Through Press by ESC can one determine, 
    that the Information updated become. Through Mouse-Double_click will_be 
    renewed to CD-ROMs wanted.

    If You `MULTITOS' improve, can You also plain one to the Appliance 
    gehîriges Laufwerkssymbol to that Window drag. `CD-Tool' try 
    then, that zugehîrige Appliance to determine and shows in Erfolgsfall the 
    zugehîrigen Data in Window to.

    Missing still the Statement, which for in Window show will_be. Ancillary 
    Device_number, -name and Version the Firmware shows `CD-Tool' also to, 
    in wieweit that betreffende GerÑte Photo-CD-fit is, and if one 
    abide may, that Audio-Commands (for Abspielen by Audio-CDs) 
    supports become.


    Come we to the single Drop-Down-MenÅs:


    Menu: `File'

    Ancillary the unerlÑûlichen `End' give it here still the MenÅpunkte for 
    Save and Print by `Reportdateien', for Save the Setting 
    as_soon_as for Save another `GerÑteinformationsdatei'. Paragraph 
    BegriffserklÑrung: in another `Reportdatei' become important 
    Information about the up_to_date Systemkonfiguration be_saved. If 
    once any not correct functions, then post You us send 
    always this File with.

    A `GerÑteinformationsdatei' again contains Data about one 
    spezielles Appliance. Also this File can us from the Fehlerdiagnose 
    high helpful be. Note You, that You this File also then 
    generate can, if `CD-Tool' that appropriate Appliance from 
    ungeklÑrten Base not as CD-ROM accept have.

    At Save the Setting noticed it `CD-Tool', to any GerÑte 
    to_grip become shall (taxi `GerÑteliste').


    Menu: `CD-ROM'

    `pick' is just then interesting, if indeed several CD-ROMs 
    found become. In this_one Case can one about this_one Menu_point that in 
    Window anzuzeigende Appliance from_refined become.

    `GerÑteliste' call one Dialogue to, about the one `CD-Tool' acquaint 
    can, any GerÑtenummern at Programmstart untersucht become 
    supposed_to. The here made Setting will_be through `File -- 
    Setting save' in another Konfigurationsdatei fixed_content.

    `Status display' shows the up_to_date GerÑtestatus to. This can 
    necessary be, about conscience Errors (as for Example the 
    Not-Diagnose one Medienwechsels) to the Lane to come.


    Menu: `METADOS'

    This Menu befaût it with the Installation and Configuration by 
    `METADOS'. Before we to the Minutiae come, must but still to one 
    important Difference to Harddiscs hingewiesen become:

    Festplattentreiber behave it to the Atari pretty bright: 
    GerÑte must not special angemeldet become and become ever to 
    Treiberversion more or minder automatic it_is_able_to. With_them become the 
    Laufwerkskennungen in the Law automatic verteilt.

    `METADOS' go indeed different before: the Configuration will_be in another 
    ASCII-File be_saved. With the Setup this File need You it 
    not to befassen, as it therefore already `CD-Tool' kÅmmert. Important 
    is but, that just the in this Konfigurationsdatei given_to GerÑte 
    found and the correspondent zugeordneten Laufwerksbuchstaben use 
    become.

    `install' copies all to METADOS gehîrigen Files in the 
    AUTO-File. Anschlieûend go's direct onward for `configure'.

    `configure' call one Dialogue to, in the each the gefundenen 
    CD-ROMs Laufwerkskennungen to_file(?) become. If You several 
    CD-ROMs own, can You with the Pfeiltasten (and per Keyboard) 
    among the single GerÑten off- and herblÑttern. [1.22]

    As Hilfestellung become top the already put_down Laufwerkskennungen 
    show: black placed for found `normal' Disk_drive, graue 
    for such_as, the already by `METADOS' served become. Scruple You, 
    that it the Number the from_the Festplattentreiber used 
    Laufwerkskennungen easy alter can (for Example through Anschluû 
    another Wechselplatte).

    Attention: Laufwerkskennungen across by `P' adjust many Programme 
    before Difficulty; under anderem the GEM-Dateiauswahlbox. Conceive You 
    also on_it, that Disk_drive `U:' under MULTITOS rather MINT already a 
    special Import have.

	The CD-ROM-Driver noticed it the zuletzt gelesenen Sectors in one 
	Cache, about zeitraubende Laufwerkszugriffe to avoid. This is 
	normally 16 KByte large, can but from Demand here vergrîûert 
	become (for Example then, if it to another CD especially groûe 
	Verzeichnisse or especially deep verschachtelte Verzeichnisse 
	find). [1.30]



    And eventual: that alter by ASCII-Konfigurationsdateien is always 
    any critical. `CD-Tool' do be Good, about all Information, the 
    with other Driver or GerÑten to do have kînnten, unchanged to 
    have. Additional will_be a Copy the originally File as 
    `CONFIG.BAK' firmed.

    `removal' desaktiviert `METADOS'. With_them will_be merely the 
    Program_file so unnammed, that you at Stop_work the AUTO-Folders 
    not more open will_be.

    `Rate' fÅhrt to one Benchmark. Choose You next that to 
    testende Appliance from. Anschlieûend become the Transferrate (it will_be 
    grave, wieviele Data that Disk_drive inside by 20 Seconds read 
    can) and the mittlere Lesezeit (20 Seconds long casual ausgewÑhlte 
    Sectors read) grave. The Transferrate will_be also as `Factor', 
    nÑmlich as Multiple the `simplify' Leserate by 150 Kbyte/s, 
    ausgegeben. Attention: the Meûwerte where also from_the Type the used CD 
    (`normal', Photo-CD etc.) dependent. [1.16]

    `Letzter Error' is anwÑhlbar, if You as Festplattentreiber 
    `HUSHI' improve and the METADOS-Driver one Error gemeldet have. In 
    this_one Case will_be the genaue GerÑtename as_soon_as a any exact 
    FehlererklÑrung show.


    Menu: `Aid'

    Contains paragraph Help_text. Which shall one as still avow?


STOPLOCK.CPX

    This is one Modul for that erweiterbare Kontrollfeld `XControl', with 
    the one the Auswurftaste the CD-ROMs bar can (provided that Appliance 
    this zulÑût). If that Disk_drive to one common zugÑnglichen Location 
    placed, can one that the Gelegenheitsdieben that Being any schwerer 
    do.

    To_the Installation must You this File in that CPX-Directory Theirs 
    Systems copy. If You negation to the Standardinstallation changed 
    have, then is the File `CPX' in Main_directory by Disk_drive `C:'.

    If You `XControl' not own (ought as `XCONTROL.ACC' to the 
    Boot_disk_drive installed be), then supposed_to You it it either from 
    another Mailbox or from Her Atari-FachhÑndler get.

    `Stop&Lock' is not just for CD-ROMs, but also for per `HUSHI' 
    (Vollversion) bediente Harddiscs effective (if You anyway 
    HUSHI-Benutzer where, know You it yes probable already) and can 
    not just the Excreta bar, but also the Laufwerksmotor 
    chop rather. again snub [1.30].

    For each for fit befundene Appliance will_be one Button show, the 
    with the to the Disk_drive gehîrigen Letter beschriftet is. One 
    einmaliger Mouse_click stoppt rather. blockiert that Appliance, one wider 
    Mouse_click give it again free. Note You, that `Stop&Lock' not 
    by_it in the Lay is, the up_to_date Setting the GerÑts to erfragen 
    and hence next always unselektierte Button shows.

    The Setting relative the Auswurfblockierung can also 
    firmed become. So can You achieve, that the Auswurfknopf to 
    one Systemstart automatic again verriegelt is.


CDDA.APP rather. CDDA.ACC

    `CD Digitally Audio' is one little Program for Abspielen by 
    Audio-CDs. `CDDA.APP' and `CDDA.ACC' where Åbrigens identical -- the 
    Jackpot as `normal' Program bids it then to, if one `MAGIC' 
    (vormals `May!x') or `MULTITOS' use.

    In the top_most Half the Fensters become the Songnummer, Index and 
    Songzahl ancillary two different Zeitanzeigen aufgefÅhrt. Which one 
    `Index' is? Some Audio-CDs -- vornehmlich from the Klassik-Area 
    -- abstain inside the Tracks still a feinere Unterteilung. If 
    as Index '00' appear, installation it it from the Lane about one 
    Datentrack, the not abgespielt become can. [1.06]

    The Zeitanzeigen where from_the momentary Mode dependent. A overall_view:

    MODE    SONG                        DISC
    remain   verbleibende Date in Carol   verbleibende Date to the CD
    current  up_to_date Position in Carol   up_to_date Position to the CD
    dead    GesamtlÑnge the Songs       GesamtlÑnge the CD

    The MODE will_be automatic umgesetzt, if Record begonnen rather. 
    has_broken will_be. Through one Mouse_click from that Say can one it also 
    manuell disguise.

    The Keys in the lowering FensterhÑlfte do in about that, which one 
    by one handelsÅblichen CD-Player expected: EJECT (Excreta), STOP, 
    START, BREAK, `one Carol back', `one Carol before', `look aback', 
    `look along' and RECORD (in this Version still unemployed). In 
    STOP-Condition can one with the last four Keys that Startlied and 
    the Startindex pick (EJECT, BREAK, Setting the Volume 
    as_soon_as the Choice the Index become at `Atari CDAR 504' not 
    supports). [1.16]

    The Tastaturbelegung [2.02]:

    'HELP'      Copyright display
    'RETURN     Play
    'E'         Eject
    'P'         Break
    'R'         Record
    'S'         Stop
    Ctrl-'Q'    Program end
    Ctrl-'U'    Window close
    '->', '+'   >
    '<-', '-'   <
    Ctrl-'->'   >>
    Ctrl-'<-'   <<
    Cursor ^    mere
    Cursor v    lower

    Count        direct for given_to Title bounce

    `CDDA' lust automatic that first CD-ROM at_best System. The found 
    Laufwerksbuchstabe will_be in Fenstertitel show. One Minuszeichen 
    placed with_them for: `no passendes Disk_drive found'.

    If You several GerÑte connected(?) have, can You `CDDA' by_it 
    coerce, one bestimmtes Appliance to improve. Style You by_it 
    `CDDA.ACC' in `CDDADRV#.ACC' about and fÅgen for `#' the Label the 
    zugehîrigen GEMDOS-Laufwerks one (correspondent for `CDDA.APP'). If 
    You `MULTITOS' and/or as Desktop `Gemini' improve, can You 
    also that Symbol the appropriate Laufwerks to that Window 
    drag (Drag&Drop). `CDDA' try then, that belong_to_it CD-ROM to 
    determine. [1.12]

    Hint: if You Storage_space save must or from other Base 
    `CDDA' not as Accessory install intend, can You CDs also 
    thereby abspielen, that You that Program `TRACK01.PRG' to the for 
    CD-ROM gehîrigen Disk_drive launch. [1.12]


    Absorb with CDDA

    With the TOSHIBA-Laufwerken XM3401 and XM4101 is it possible, 
    Audiodaten direct by CD `aufzunehmen', about you then to the Computer 
    weiterzubearbeiten. Before we to_the Service this Function come, 
    must indeed one couple Concepts geklÑrt become.

    To Audio-CDs become for every Second Music 176400 Bytes be_saved. 
    That load(?) it leich nachrechnen: 44100 Value per Second (that is the 
    `Samplingfrequenz') * 16 Bits per Value * two KanÑle (right and 
    left). This is natural a hugeness Datenmenge, hence bids 
    `CDDA' several Possiblity, this Deal at_least one little to 
    reduce.

    So can one in_place_of the 16-Bit-Formats also among two 
    different 8-Bit-Format choose (8 Bit linear and 8 Bit 
    logarithmisch -- 'mu-law'). As one it conceive can, leidet 
    indeed the KlangqualitÑt under; eventual will_be the 
    `Auslenkung' the Lautsprechermembran now just still to 1/256 (in_place_of 
    by 1/65536) exact be_saved. That is always then mindful, if to_the 
    Wider_processing anyway just eight Bits to Direction placed 
    (for_example to one Atari TT or STE). That logarithmische 
    'mu-law'-Format use likewise just eight Bits, verteilt the Value 
    indeed not equal, but before the menschlichen 
    Hîrvermîgen correspondent.

    To Audio-CDs is the Music as said with 44100 Meûwerten (`Samples') 
    per Second digitizes. Alas can neither STE, TT still Falcon 
    any with Sounddaten this Samplingrate become. `CDDA' bids hence 
    the Possibility, to 49612 Samples per Second hochzurechnen. Attention: 
    first will_be thereby the Ausgabedatei major, zweitens go with_them the 
    Original-Data lost. Who to his Falcon the Possibility have, 
    with 44100Hz-Samples to work (about a appropriate 
    Hardwareerweiterung), ought so of_it unconditional Use do.

    A wider Possibility, the Datenmenge to confine, is in Mono 
    aufzunehmen. With_them become both KanÑle zusammengemischt and the 
    resultant Datenmenge is logischerweise just half so large.

    Eventual place it still the Query, any Dateiformat for the 
    Sounddaten use become shall. Just_as as from Grafikdateien give it 
    also here one regelrechten Formatdschungel. `CDDA' supports hence 
    alike three Format, with then it possible be ought, exist Data 
    Åberallhin to adopt. That `WAV'-Format is that Musikdatenformat 
    by Microsoft Windows and can hence to operative each Calculator 
    read become. That `AVR'-Format is a Device the Atari-Department 
    and will_be by many Programs to `unserer' Rechnerfamilie 
    supports. That `AU'-Format eventual entstammt the Unix-Area 
    and find vornehmlich to SUN- and NEXT-Workstations Usage. 
    Attention: that `mu-law'-Datenformat can just at `AU'-Format from_refined 
    become.

    To Press the Reception-Key appear a Dialogbox, in the even 
    this Setting carried_out become can (you appear not, 
    if the eingelegte CD no_one Audio-CD is or that Disk_drive not for 
    Read by Audio-Data fit is).

    Ancillary the already angesprochenen Setting can You now still the 
    Early- and Endzeit as_soon_as the Aufnahmepegel attune. HierfÅr sets 
    `CDDA' automatic the Zeiten for that live show Carol one. The 
    Statement comprises from Minuten, Seconds and `Frames', with_which every Second 
    from 75 Frames comprises. The Notensymbole ancillary the Zeitangaben allow 
    it, respectively the Origin and that Conclusion `anzuspielen'.

    At_best lowering Border the Dialogbox will_be show, as large the Sounddatei 
    in about become will_be.

    Now to_the Volume: direct at Export as 8-Bit-Data and from gentle 
    aufgenommenen CDs can it incidence, that the Rauschpegel high high 
    is. `CDDA' able it hence, the Volume anzuheben. If it 
    with_them to another öbersteuerung came, will_be `CDDA' that at_best Conclusion the Reception 
    notify.

    Attention: the `Original'-Data gain You just from `Stereo', `16 Bit', 
    `44100 Hz' and Volume 1.00. In all other Fell fÅhrt `CDDA' 
    the a or other Calculation or Datenreduktion through!

    Through Activate by `Save...' will_be now the Reception restart. 
    Give You by_it the gewÅnschten Filename one. The resultant File 
    can then by einschlÑgigen Programs as `SAM' (System Audio 
    Manager, Atari), `Crazy Sounds' (Maxon) or `WinRec'    
    (Schînfeld/Binner, Shareware) weiterbearbeitet become.


Arbitrierung [1.30]

   The SCSI-Standard see the so_called `Arbitrierung' before. In the 
   Practice means this, that the Calculator a own SCSI-Known verpaût 
   will_be, about the he it from Zugriffen to the Bus `identifies'. 

   Attention: the eingestellte Known (in GerÑtelistendialog) can then by 
   keinem other Appliance more use become. Normally wÑhlt one the 
   Value 7 (from many Wahlschaltern for SCSI-Addresses can ohnehin just 
   Value among 0 and 6 installed become).

   From eingeschalteter Arbitrieung shows `ID-Test' to the ausgewÑhlten 
   Address future the GerÑtenamen -- about `Atari TT030' -- to.

   Note You, that SCSI-Arbitrierung at_best ACSI-Bus not possible is.


CD-ROM-DISK_DRIVE FROM THE DOS-AREA [1.22]

    Often become we in_demand, any `approve' CD-ROM-Disk_drive from the 
    DOS-Area use become can. So: it give three Gattungen by 
    Laufwerken:

    SCSI-Disk_drive: SCSI-GerÑte can to Falcon and TT direct, to other 
    Ataris per ACSI-Hostadapter connected(?) become. But that know You 
    yes already long...

    IDE-Disk_drive: CD-ROMs with IDE-Cut_place(?) come early now long 
    to the Market (the Standard becomes early Conclusion 1993 verabschiedet). 
    Probable will_be one this GerÑte to the Falcon (internal 
    IDE-Cut_place(?)) and to TOS-IDE-Adapterkarten (as the by Hard & 
    Soft) anschlieûen can. If Hard&Soft instead Treibersoftware tender 
    will_be, clinches alone the Inquiry.

    Disk_drive with herstellerspezifischer Cut_place(?): this Disk_drive 
    become at_best PC either with another eigenen Controllerkarte or at_best 
    Anschluû another Soundkarte betrieben. For the Service to Ataris have 
    Hard&Soft no_one Answer in Program. Attention: all Mitsumi-Disk_drive 
    by to the all new GerÑte with IDE-Interface belong to this 
    Group.


MINT and MULTITOS [1.30]

	`METADOS' can together with `MINT' rather. `MULTITOS' use become. 
	With_them where following Point to note:

	- `METADOS.PRG' must before `MINT.PRG' rather. `MINTNP.PRG' in Auto-File 
	placed.

	- You need a neuere `MINT'-Version as diejenige, the Atari 
	with `MULTITOS' ausliefert. In File `MINT' be it the news 
	by Atari freigegebene Version (1.12 from_the November 1994). To_the 
	Installation:

		(1) Vergewissern You it, that You not already a neuere 
		`MINT'-Version as Version 1.12 improve.

		(2) Do You a Sicherheitskopie the in AUTO-File 
		befindlichen `MINT'-Version.

		(3) Style You if_need_be the File `MINTNP.PRG' so about, that 
		You just_as means, as the already to in AUTO-File installierte 
		Version.

		(4) Copy you this File in the AUTO-File. With_them will_be the 
		hitherto installierte Version Åberschrieben!

	Attention: in `MINT'-File find it several 
	(englischsprachige) Files, the avow, under welchen Bedinungen 
	`MINT' weitergebeben may. Send read!


AVOWED PROBLEM BY METADOS

    Some Programme act not correct with `METADOS', because you 
    from System_call not all vorgeschriebenen Register 
    save. That drÅckt it often thereby from, that Files done not or 
    just incomplete read become can (not just such_as by the 
    CD!). Revert You it in Zweifelsfall to the Maker the Program 
    and ask You to one Update.

    Many Programme allow none Access to Disk_drive with 
    Laufwerksbuchstaben major `P:'. Abhilfe: one other 
    Laufwerksbuchstaben improve or that Program through a aktuellere 
    Version replace. Attention: also the Dateisauswahlbox in GEM can just 
    16 Disk_drive display; in PD- and Sharewarebereich give it but a 
    whole File by schînen Ersatzprogrammen (as for Example 
    `Selectric').

    Unchanged Version the Atari-Desktop dart down, if the 
    LÑngenangaben by Files `to large' become (`Info display' rather. 
    Verzeichnisfenster in Textdarstellung). Abhilfe: neuere ROM-Version 
    (for_example TOS 2.06) improve or one other Desktop 
    employ (Examples: Gemini, Ease etc.).

    For Benutzer by Kommandoshells: it is not possible, at Access 
    to METADOS-GerÑte One-/Ausgabeumlenkung to improve.
