MiNT is a multitasking kernel for the Atari ST/TT/Falcon. It runs on
all Atari compatible hardware that I know of.

Note that MiNT is *not* MultiTOS; it is only a small part of MultiTOS.
MultiTOS is a commercial product which includes a new, multitasking
version of GEM. If you do not have MultiTOS, MiNT will not allow
you to multitask GEM programs. It will allow you to run any number
of TOS/TTP programs, together with one (1) GEM program. The easiest
way to do this is to use the TOSWIN desk accessory (available from
many Atari archive sites) to launch the TOS/TTP programs.

Note also that this version of MiNT is not officially supported by
anyone. If you have problems with it, you *might* get help if you
send a message to mint@atari.archive.umich.edu; then again, you
might not. It all depends on the mood of the people on the MiNT
mailing list. The Usenet newsgroup comp.sys.atari.st is also a
good place to ask questions about MiNT.
