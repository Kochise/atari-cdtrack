Here is the executable for the newest version of MiNT. This binary
may be redistributed, subject to the conditions in the file "copying".
Please read the notice in "copying" carefully. This code is completely
unsupported; you use it at your own risk.

Instructions:

(1) To upgrade your existing MultiTOS installation:
	Look in your AUTO folder. You should have a file in there
	called either MINT.PRG or MINTNP.PRG. Rename that file to
	MINT.BAK or MINTNP.BAK (so that you can recover if something
	goes wrong). Copy the file MINTNP.PRG from this distribution
	into the AUTO folder.

(2) To run MiNT without MultiTOS:
	Copy MINTNP.PRG into your AUTO folder. Generally it should be
	the last thing in the AUTO folder, although this is not
	absolutely required; some experimentation may be necessary
	to figure out where the best place to put it is.

(3) Now reboot. The new version of MiNT will run. If you have software
    that knows about MiNT (e.g. MultiTOS's GEM.SYS program) then you're
    all set. Otherwise, you won't notice much difference; your system
    will be capable of multitasking, but unless you have a desktop or
    shell that can launch multiple programs, you won't be able to
    take advantage of that fact. There are many freeware shells (such
    as BASH, TCSH, and TOSWIN) that can let you multitask when used
    with MiNT.

OK, those are pretty slim instructions. Sorry. If you have trouble
using MiNT, I'd suggest you get a pre-packaged version, e.g. MultiTOS,
or the MiNTos distribution, or something like that.
