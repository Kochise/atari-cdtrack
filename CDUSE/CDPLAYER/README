The language of the menus, dialogs and messages within CD-Player can be
changed by replacing the file CDP.RSC with one of the .RSC files in the
RESOURCE folder. Copy the desired RSC file to the same directory as
CDP.APP and rename it to CDP.RSC (delete or rename the existing RSC file).

If there are more than one MetaDOS device, you can select the CD-ROM by
renaming CDP.APP to CDP_x.APP (x is the letter of the CD-ROM which is used
by the DESKTOP)
